# jira-issue

This is a provider skill under `providers/jira/skills/jira-issue`.

## Purpose

Handle Jira Issue CRUD by orchestrating local scripts in `scripts/` that call Jira REST API.

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when user intent is any of:
- Create issue / report bug / log incident
- Get issue details
- Update issue fields
- Delete issue

## Script Entry Points

- `scripts/create_issue.py`
- `scripts/get_issue.py`
- `scripts/update_issue.py`
- `scripts/delete_issue.py`

## Invocation Guidance

When the user says:
- "Create a Jira issue for service startup failure"

Construct and run:

```bash
python app/atlasclaw/providers/jira/skills/jira-issue/scripts/create_issue.py \
  --summary "Service startup failure" \
  --description "Service failed to start due to a database connection timeout"
```

Then return created issue key to user.

## Notes

- Scripts read Jira connection from `atlasclaw.json` (`service_providers.jira`).
- API mappings are in `references/api_mapping.md`.
- Skill scripts are part of this skill package, not standalone global skills.
